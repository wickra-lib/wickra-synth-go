**Deterministic synthetic-microstructure generation for Go, over the Wickra C ABI hub via cgo.**

Wickra Synth generates synthetic order-book and trade microstructure from a seeded
spec — regimes, spreads and trade rates folded once in a Rust core, so the output
is byte-identical across every language for a given seed. This package is the Go
binding; it consumes the C ABI hub through cgo and drives the generator over the
same JSON protocol as every other binding.

## Install

Use the published **`wickra-synth-go`** module, which bundles the prebuilt
C ABI library for every platform, so `go get` + `go build` works with no extra
steps (a C compiler is still required, as the binding uses cgo):

```bash
go get github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth-go
```

```go
import wickra "github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth-go"
```

`wickra-synth-go` is generated from the [`bindings/go`](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth/tree/main/bindings/go)
directory by the release pipeline: it mirrors the Go sources, the vendored C ABI
header (`include/wickra_synth.h`) and the prebuilt libraries under
`lib/<goos>_<goarch>/`. On Linux/macOS the library path is baked in via rpath; on
Windows the DLL must be discoverable at run time (next to the executable or on
`PATH`).

### Building from this repository (contributors)

The `bindings/go` directory in the [wickra-synth](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth)
repository is the development source. To build it directly, compile the C ABI and
stage the library into the per-platform directory cgo links against:

```bash
cargo build -p wickra-synth-c --release
mkdir -p lib/linux_amd64                             # match your GOOS_GOARCH
cp target/release/libwickra_synth.so    lib/linux_amd64/    # Linux
cp target/release/libwickra_synth.dylib lib/darwin_arm64/   # macOS (arm64)
cp target/release/wickra_synth.dll      lib/windows_amd64/  # Windows
```

## Quick start

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	wickra "github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth-go"
)

func main() {
	spec := `{"seed":42,"bars":20,"start_price":100.0,` +
		`"regimes":[{"kind":"trend","len":20,"drift":0.002,"vol":0.01}],` +
		`"microstructure":{"book_depth":5,"spread_bps":4.0,"trade_rate":8.0}}`

	synth, err := wickra.New(spec)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer synth.Close()

	resp, err := synth.Command(`{"cmd":"generate"}`)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(resp)
}
```

Domain errors (a bad command, an unknown command name) come back as an
`{"ok": false, "error": ...}` response, not as a returned `error`; the `error` is
reserved for hard failures at the C ABI boundary. Every handle owns native memory
freed by `Close()`; a finalizer is wired as a backstop, but call `Close()` (e.g.
with `defer`) to release it promptly.

## Documentation

The full guides, quickstarts, and API reference live in the main repository and
documentation site:

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth>
- **Docs:** <https://wickra.org>
- **Runnable examples:** [`examples/go/`](https://github.com/wickra-lib/wickra-synth/tree/main/examples/go)

Wickra ships native bindings for Python, Node.js, WASM and Rust, plus a
C ABI hub that any C-capable language (C, C++, C#, Go, Java, R) links against —
all exposing the same core from the shared, `unsafe`-forbidden Rust core.
